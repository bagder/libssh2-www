Possible integer overflow in keyboard interactive handling allows out-of-bounds write
=======================================

Project libssh2 Security Advisory, March 18 2019 -
[Permalink](https://www.libssh2.org/CVE-2019-3856.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

A server could send a value approaching unsigned int max number of keyboard
prompt requests which could result in an unchecked integer overflow. The value
would then be used to allocate memory causing a possible memory write out of
bounds error (CWE-130).


There are no known exploits of this flaw at this time.

INFO
----

CVE-2019-3856 to this issue.

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

- Affected versions: all versions to and including 1.8.0
- Not affected versions: libssh2 >= 1.8.1

THE SOLUTION
------------

libssh2 1.8.1 ensures keyboard prompt requests value is less than 100 before
proceeding with the login process.


A patch for this problem is [available](https://libssh2.org/1.8.0-CVE/CVE-2019-3856.patch)

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:

A - Upgrade to libssh2 1.8.1 or later

B - Apply the patch and rebuild libssh2
